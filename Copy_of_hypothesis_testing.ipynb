        "\n",
        "### Answer:\n",
        "A null hypothesis (H₀) is a statement which assumes that there is no change, no effect, or no difference in the population. It acts as the starting point for any hypothesis test.  \n",
        "It is important because the whole test is done to check whether we have enough evidence to reject this assumption or not.\n",

        "\n",
        "## Question 2: What does the significance level (α) represent in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "\n",
        "### Answer:\n",
        "The significance level α tells us the probability of making a Type I error, which means rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true.  \n",
        "Common values are 0.05 and 0.01, meaning we accept a 5% or 1% chance of such an error.\n",

        "\n",
        "## Question 3: Differentiate between Type I and Type II errors.\n",

        "### Answer:\n",
        "A one-tailed test checks for an effect in only one direction (either greater than or less than some value).  \n",
        "Example: H₁: μ > 10  \n",
        "\n",
        "A two-tailed test checks for an effect in both directions.  \n",

        "A Z-test is used when the population standard deviation is known or when the sample size is large (30 or more).  \n",
        "A t-test is used when the population standard deviation is unknown and the sample size is small.\n",
